      <h3>Egg-citing Facts For You</h3>
      <p> 1.) Many believe that the largest egg discovered was laid in 1896 by a Lancashire hen. Its egg was 9 inches in diameter and weighed an astonishing 340! However, Harriett beat this record in 2012 with its 9.1 inch diameter egg. At least it was another Brit! <br> 2.) "Yolk" is the old English term for "yellow" so instead of "egg whites and egg yolk", it ought to be "egg whites and egg yellows." <br> 3.) On average, a whopping 11 billion eggs are laid in the UK each year which makes the UK 86% self-sufficient in this area!</p>
